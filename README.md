### About

Colors is a random color-generating application， powered by the xColors API by cheatsnake. It allows users to explore different colors and find inspiration. With a simple click on the home page, users will get a random color with its RGB, HEX & HSL codes. Users can also explore a collection of colors along with our filter feature.
